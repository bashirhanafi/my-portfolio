## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges I faced was integrating the machine learning models with the backend system to ensure smooth communication between the recommendation engine and the application interface. Ensuring scalability, low latency, and seamless API responses required close collaboration with backend developers and deep understanding of deployment workflows. Through this experience, I learned the importance of building modular and well-documented APIs, as well as how to bridge the gap between data science prototypes and production-ready systems.
