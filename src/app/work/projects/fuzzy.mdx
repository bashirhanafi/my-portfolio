## Overview
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a policy or initiative by organizations to contribute to surrounding communities and the environment, aiming to support the company's sustainability. One notable CSR program is "Relawan Bakti BUMN" by Indonesia’s Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, which allows BUMN employees to voluntarily engage in social and environmental programs. The success of such programs heavily relies on the volunteers, making their quality a crucial factor. Volunteer quality is influenced by participation duration, contribution time, and training time, all of which affect both the impact on society and the volunteers themselves. To assess this quality, a fuzzy inference system—specifically the Tsukamoto method—is proposed, using "if-then" rules to map inputs to outputs and determine volunteer effectiveness in CSR programs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for building the fuzzy inference system.
- **skfuzzy**: For creating fuzzy sets and implementing the Tsukamoto fuzzy logic.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing fuzzy membership functions.

## Future Insights

The conclusion of this system is that the Tsukamoto fuzzy method can effectively assess volunteer quality in CSR programs by evaluating key factors such as participation period, contribution time, and training availability. The outcome depends on how well the input variables and fuzzy rules are defined. This approach offers a flexible and objective way to support decision-making in CSR, and it holds potential for broader implementation in corporate volunteer management systems.

## Challenges and Learnings

A current challenge in this project was defining the parameters of the fuzzy membership functions, which greatly influence the system's accuracy and reliability. In the future, this limitation can be addressed by utilizing real-world data to set more representative parameters and by adopting hybrid models like fuzzy-neural networks (fuzzy-NN) to make the fuzzy system more adaptive and responsive to diverse input conditions.
