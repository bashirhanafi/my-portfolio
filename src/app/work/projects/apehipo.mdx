## Overview

APEHIPO (Aplikasi Pertanian Hidroponik) is a mobile-based platform that provides a marketplace for hydroponic farmers to sell their products while also assisting in the management of hydroponic farming to achieve optimal yields. APEHIPO is also designed for consumers interested in hydroponic products, allowing them to easily find high-quality hydroponic produce. APEHIPO offers several key features, including HydroCommerce, HydroManage, and HydroTrends.
## Key Features
- **HidroCommerce**: Connects farmers and consumers in the sale of hydroponic products
- **Manage Garden**: Enables farmers to monitor plant growth, schedule harvest periods, and optimize agricultural yields
- **Business Networking**: Discuss hydroponic farming with fellow farmers, share tips and experiences for better outcomes
- **V-Trends**: Understand market demand for hydroponic products based on current trends

## Technologies Used

- **Dart**: Serves as the core programming language to build APEHIPO's application logic and integrate features
- **Flutter**:  Used to develop a responsive and user-friendly mobile interface for both farmers and consumers, enabling seamless interaction with features
- **Android Studio**: Functions as the main development environment for designing, building, and testing the APEHIPO mobile application across Android devices
- **Codeigniter**: Powers the backend system, including data management and the implementation of rule-based logic

## Outcome

APEHIPO has successfully partnered with several stakeholders in South Kalimantan, gained dozens of users through app downloads, and has been showcased in multiple expos and competitions as a promising innovation in smart hydroponic farming.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges in developing APEHIPO was addressing its niche market nature, which made it difficult to attract and retain users at scale. As a platform focused on hydroponic farming—a relatively specific and emerging agricultural practice—public awareness and adoption were initially limited. This challenge pushed us to think more creatively in terms of outreach, education, and user engagement strategies. Through this experience, I learned the importance of understanding user behavior in niche markets, the value of building strong partnerships with local stakeholders, and the need to continuously iterate on product features based on real user feedback to ensure long-term relevance and impact.
