## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges in developing Connect Skills was the lack of a framework, which made it difficult to build a modular and maintainable code structure. Without built-in support for routing, templating, and code organization, managing the growing complexity of the application became a challenge. As a solution, adopting a PHP framework such as Laravel or CodeIgniter in future development would help improve code modularity, scalability, and overall development efficiency.
